# PS-for-finite-lengths-DM-and-SpSh

This package contains the MATLAB scripts to generate figures from:

Y. C. Gültekin, T. Fehenberger, A. Alvarado, and F. M. J. Willems, “Probabilistic shaping
for finite blocklengths: Distribution matching and sphere shaping,” Entropy, vol. 19, no. 5:
581, May 2020; https://doi.org/10.3390/e22050581.

As an example, to generate Fig. 5, the MATLAB script Fig_5. should be run while all the necessary functions and files (provided in the repository in .m or .mat format) are present in the path.
